          <p> <strong>Game Description</strong> </p>
        <p>
          Play as a cool sun with sunglasses and collect mini suns to defeat faces. When you beat a face, you fight a new one until they're all defeated. Each face has a different attack pattern, and more health as you get further along. To move, you have to move your head as you wear any Bose device. Collect small suns and defeat the faces before they destroy you with water bottles!

          <p> <strong>My Experience</strong> </p>
        <p>
          We made this during HACK WPI 2020. This was the first game I ever made using motion controls so I'm super proud! This is also my second 3D game which I want to do more of, so I'm extremely proud of the project. We made a very silly game that's even sillier to watch people play.

          I ran into a lot of challenges. At first you were supposed to headbutt the face, but we changed it to more of a bullet hell type style because that would have been too much motion to get right in a short amount of time. I spent almost eight hours working on just the movement on Day 1 of the hackathon. I finally got it to a workable state, and spent all of Day 2 strictly on content. It was an extremely tricky process since Bose only tracks acceleration, so I had to build movement with only that. Thankfully I had a lot of help from the people of Bose and some fellow hackers! Halfway through the hackathon we figured out we couldn't make a windows version, so we made it mobile. I think it made the game turn out for the better!
