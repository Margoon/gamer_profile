          <p> <strong>Game Description</strong> </p>
        <p>
          Last Slice is a 1-4 player party brawler. The goal is get the last slice of pizza left every round by fighting off your friends with your fists and whatever's laying around. Whoever gets the set amount of slices first wins, but the longer the game lasts, the weirder the game gets.
         <p> <strong>My Experience</strong> </p>
          Last Slice was originally made during a game jam in April 2019. The team was pretty big and after it no one had enough time or want to really flesh out the game. So it stayed as a jam game for about half a year until a final team was made and preproduction started in November 2019. With the jam version we had a clear idea of what we wanted to make and already had ideas of what we wanted to expand on. We spent time makings malleable systems so making content going forward would be easier. I made weapons as scriptable objects with custom editors, so implementing new weapons of any type would be easy, and making variations would be even easier. We really hit the ground running with development, and have been making changes to gameplay based on reactions at showcases. Around May we decided to completely change the art style of the game to give it a more unique style and feel.
