          <p> <strong>My Experience</strong> </p>
        <p>
          Phantom Comedy Theatre was made for Global Game Jam 2024. This was the first released game that I made by myself completely (except for help with extra voice acting). I spent a lot of time thinking of the concept, and this was my first time I did art for a game. I also had to write all the comedy scripts, and even though they're not supposed to be great comedians, it was still tough to write 5 comedy sets that were funny enough. I also haven't used GameMaker in a while, but had a lot of fun using it again! The concept is kind of like an arcade game, but there's a comedy standup happening in the background. The last level has completely random values and is infinite. All in all, the game is kinda funny.
