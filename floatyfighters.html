           Floaty Fighters is a free-movement fighting game with a focus on projectile attacks. Each character has a unique playstyle where each character has four base moves, and they all work in tandem with each other. Being able to maximize the potential of your fighter is the key to the game.

            Floaty Fighters is my passion project, and it was made with a strong base of my strengths as a game dev: single screen games, free movement, and multiplayer games. It has been in development for about a year, and since it's conception I've brought it to many game dev events, usually by holding mini-tournaments at it's booth. By doing this we've gotten great feedback on what people like about the game, what people don't, and what people want added to the game. We've also built a small community around the game by bringing it to game dev events. I'm looking forward to working on this game and making it the best it can be.
